# OptimalRouteKL

**OptimalRouteKL** is a web application that helps users find the most efficient route between a series of destinations in Kuala Lumpur. It also provides a detailed travel advisory for the optimized route, including landmarks, optimal travel times, and local experiences.

## Features

- **Travel advisory:** The application provides a detailed travel advisory for the optimized route, generated by a large language model.
- **Responsive design:** The application is designed to be used on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Axios, React Router
- **Backend:** Flask, Google Maps API, OpenRouter API

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: a frontend application and a backend API.

- **Frontend:** The frontend is a single-page application built with React. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling and Axios for making API requests.
- **Backend:** The backend is a Flask API that provides two main endpoints:
    - `/api/optimize_route`: This endpoint takes a list of locations and returns the optimized route.
    - `/api/analyze_route`: This endpoint takes an optimized route and returns a travel advisory.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you will need to have Python and Node.js installed on your machine. You will also need to create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following variables:

```
MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

Once you have created the `.env` file, you can run the following commands to start the application:

```
# Start the backend API
cd backend
-pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Start the frontend application
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
